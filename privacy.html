            <p><strong>We do not collect, receive, or have access to any of your health data.</strong> All glucose readings, statistics, and personal information stay exclusively on your device. The app only connects to LibreLinkUp (Abbott's service) to fetch your glucose readings directly to your device.</p>
            <p><strong>Anonymous Analytics:</strong> We collect minimal anonymous usage data (like total user count and aggregate statistics) to understand how the app is being used. This data contains no personal or health information.</p>

            <p>The app makes two types of external connections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LibreLinkUp:</strong> Direct connection between your device and LibreLinkUp servers (owned by Abbott, not us) using your credentials to fetch your glucose data. We are not involved in this connection.</li>

            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Security</h2>

                <li>All data remains on your device and is protected by your device's security measures (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)</li>
                <li>We use secure HTTPS connections when communicating with LibreLinkUp servers</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
